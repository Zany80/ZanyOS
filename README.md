# ZenithOS

ZenithOS is a hobby operating system I'm writing. It will *only* run Zenith80 programs, and probably won't work on your specific
hardware unless you either write some drivers yourself or let me know. If you contact me, don't expect immediate results. As of this
commit, the only thing that's implemented is the VGA Mode 3 driver. There's a lot of work to go before it's useful for anything, if
ever.
